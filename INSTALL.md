To compile this code, you will need to install [Mono C# compiler](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/).

To compile, open the Mono Command prompt (which, if you are using Windows, will be created in your start menu), navigate to where you have the .cs file saved then type into the command line, `csc BasicCalculator.cs`
Then after the program has finished being compiled, type into the command prompt, `mono BasicCalculator.exe`

Now you can run the .exe file and use the program
